# git-action

This is a sample repository showcasing the use of GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

The repository contains a simple Node.js application, with a workflow defined in the .github/workflows directory.

The workflow is triggered on each push to the repository and runs a series of tasks, such as:

- Installing dependencies
- Building the application
- Running unit tests

If all the tasks are successful, the workflow will be marked as completed and a new version of the application will be deployed.

To use this repository as a template for your own project, simply fork the repository and modify the workflow to fit your needs. For more information on GitHub Actions, see the official documentation.
